# Markdown Experiment 3000

Another experiment with Markdown files and frontmatter.

This mixes strongly-typed frontmatter with the content of a markdown file
into an instance of `MarkdownObject<T>` so that it can be passed
around. This allows you to use structured HTML pages, with a hint of 
dynamic content in the form of a Markdown document.
